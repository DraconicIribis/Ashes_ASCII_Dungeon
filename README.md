# Ashes_ASCII_Dungeon
# A simple ASCII dungeon game using advanced recursion to represent levels. Coded in C++ for the GAME 140 class at George Mason University.

This game is played entirely in the Windows console. I have not tested the Linux console yet, but I am sure it will refuse to work on there.

Not only does this game represent advanced recursive looping, but the game code introduces taking information about the Windows console, such as max size. Extracting this data, the game map is made.
 
Read the Walkthrough.txt file if you wish for a total walkthrough of the game for testing. Otherwise, for all the surprises to remain a surprise, play without reading.

Controls are simple: WASD to move and <filler> to open the key
Move into objects to pickup, unlock, or open them. Works for combatting enemies too.
